# Project report

The project is reported once a year, usually at the turn of February / March.

A reminder sent in advance by e-mail to principal investigator and users.
The report shall be submited into the system by the principal investigator (PI).

The PI's task is to summarize the project calculations and justify the use of ICM resources.

## Why shall you submit the report

!!! info "Why are reports important?"
    The reports are required to obtain funds for the development and maintenance of the Computing Center (including the purchase of computing servers) and access to computing capabilities (energy costs, technical service, technical support for calculators, etc.).

    Failure to submit a report by the principal investigator may result in the closure of the project.

    Both, you and us wish to keep the scientific calculations non-commercial.

## How to prepare a report

The report should include:

- summary of activities and results of calculations
- information about the software used
- information about the machines on which the calculations were carried out
- the amount of resources used (CPUh)
- information about the possibility of using parallel calculations
- short information on grants (NCN, NCBiR, FP7 and others) in which calculations conducted at ICM are used
- publications related to the computational grant
- information on promoted master's and doctoral theses
- the report should contain only text (no diagrams, no attachments, etc.).

It is worth remembering to verify:

- project summaries
- contact details of PI and users (please remember to update academic titles, telephone numbers and e-mails).

### Publications

All publications related to the project should be
included on the project's website and contain the following information:
