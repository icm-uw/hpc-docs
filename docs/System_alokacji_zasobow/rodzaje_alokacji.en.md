# Types of Allocations

The allocation type depends on the amount of requested CPUh
and a supercomputer ([Okeanos, Topola, Rysy](../O_zasobach_ICM/Zasoby/komputery_w_icm.md))
on which the calculations are to be performed.

## Topola

**Standard allocation**

On the Topola supercomputer, only one type of grant is awarded, amounting to 1 million core hours.

## Rysy

Due to the relatively small size and specificity of the Rysy supercomputer (GPU cluster), allocations are negotiated individually.
This supercomputer is an experimental machine, therefore no dedicated software is installed in the operating system.
The main usage is focused on fundamental research related to machine learning, with low computational complexity.
The application should justify the need to use the GPU in the calculations.

## Okeanos

The resources of the Okeanos supercomputer are made available primarily to scientists,
whose research work requires the use of massively parallel calculations.

**A Allocation: Great Challenges**

Type A allocations are intended for teams requesting computing time in excess of 2 million core hours. 
Due to the amount of resources, bpth the requests for A allocations and annoual reports are rigorously assessed.

**B allocation: Standard**

Type B allocations are granted to teams requesting computation time no more than 2 million core hours.

**C: Test allocation**

Type C allocations are granted to teams requesting low computing resources
(~20,000 core hours) needed to test software or computational models.
The main purpose of type C grants is to collect information necessary to apply for a type A or B grant.
Applications will only be assessed in formal and technical terms.
Computational resources for Type C grants will be awarded for 6 months.

## Rules for allocating allocations

Applications are subject to formal, technical and scientific assessment by an Opinion Panel composed of scientists from various fields of computational sciences.

The assessment will take into account:

- scientific purpose of the research being carried out,
- the validity of the use of large-scale calculations, including massively parallel calculations,
- preparation the applicant and his team to realization of the project,
- the technical feasibility of the project on a given supercomputer, including the availability of tools and the amount of the available resources,
- in the case of research teams that have already performed calculations in ICM, one of the elements
 the results obtained from previous projectes will also be assessed.
- projects requiring the use of large-scale calculations with breakthrough importance in their fields of science are particularly promoted.

ICM reserves the right to allocate less than requested computing resources
or to provide a computing system other than the requested one.

## The duration of the allocation

By default, access to a supercomputer is granted for 1 per year.
If the allocated allocation is not used, it is possible to extend it for another year.

## Deadlines for submitting applications

Applications are accepted continuously.
