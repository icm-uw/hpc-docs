Grant owner can [add members](./en_jak_wystapic_o_grant_obliczeniowy.md)
at any stage. It is the owner's responsibility to coordinate all
aspects of the active grant, including results reporting, providing
information on project-related papers, and adding an appropriate [ICM
reference](./en_rozliczanie_grantu.md) to every publication. The users
working in more than one grant should make sure to specify the correct
grant ID in the job scripts submitted to the scheduling system.
