Title: Grant reporting

Grant reporting takes place once a year, usually in March/April. A
remainder is e-mailed in advance to all registered grant owners.

Grant owner's responsibilities include submitting a report which
should be an overview of the project including:

  - Obtained results,
  - Specification of the software used within the project,
  - Information on the machines used to run calculations,
  - Resources used (CPU core hours),
  - Information on other grants (NCN, NCBiR, FP7, etc.) in which the ICM results are used.

Please make sure to provide also the following information within the
grant management system:

  - Update the list of publications related to the project,
  - Attach papers, reports, presentations as PDF files,
  - Project's abstract,
  - Verified contact information to the grant owner and members.

Please make sure to close the accounts of former grant members.

To every grant-related publication, the following clause should be added:

  '''This research was carried out with the support of the
Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling
(ICM), University of Warsaw, under grant no Gxx-xx '''
