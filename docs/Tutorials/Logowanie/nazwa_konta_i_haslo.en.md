# User name and password

The user name and password are created at the time of 
[user registration](../../Podrecznik_grantowy/zakladanie_konta.en.md) in the grant database 
(applies to the grant manager) or at the stage of 
[adding a contractor to the grant](../../Podrecznik_grantowy/jak_wystapic_o_grant_obliczeniowy.en.md).
The password is sent automatically by e-mail to the address provided in the registration form.

- The account name consists of max. 8 characters. It is not the e-mail address provided during the first registration in the grant database, but the login created in the second stage of registration.
- Note: the password generated on the form is not activated. Only the password sent by e-mail should be used.
- The grant manager should also create an account with a maximum of 8 characters, 
[adding himself as contractor to the grant](../../Podrecznik_grantowy/jak_wystapic_o_grant_obliczeniowy.en.md).

In case of difficulties with obtaining the correct password for the account, please send an e-mail to help pomoc([monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#Names_in_other_languages))icm.edu.pl

## Password change
