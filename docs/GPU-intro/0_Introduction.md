## CUDA Notes

Some frequently used commands/qualifiers/concepts are listed below for convenience

### Functions qualifers

```.cpp
__global__ // launched by CPU on device (must return void)
__device__ // called from other GPU functions (never CPU)
__host__   // can be executed by CPU (can be used together with __device__)
```

### Copying memory

The memory between host and device can be copied in two ways.
The synchronous callblocks the CPU until the copy is complete.
Copy begins when all preceding CUDA calls have completed.

```.cpp
cudaMemcpy (void ∗dst, const void ∗src, size t count, enum cudaMemcpyKind kind)
```

Asynchronous call which does not block the CPU is `cudaMemcpyAsync(...)`

### Kernel launch

Kernel launches are asynchronous - Control returns to the CPU immediately.

```.cpp
f_name<<<gridDim, blockDim, sharedMem, strId>>>(p1,... pN)
```

To block the CPU until all preceding CUDA calls have completed call

```.cpp
cudaDeviceSynchronize()
```

### Dimensions of the block/grid

<center> ![](GPU_images/CUDA_Thread_Block_Idx.png) </center>

The gridDim and blockDim are 3D variables.
However, if the y or z dimension is not specified explicitly then the defualt value 1 is prescribed for y or z.

Declaration of the size of block/grid:

```.cpp
dim3 gridDim   // This variable describes number of blocks in the grid in each dimension.
dim3 blockDim  // This variable describes number of threads in the block in each dimension.
```

#### Setting the dimensions of a kernel

Given N as the size of the problem the block/grid dimenesions can be evalueated as

```.cpp
// N is a friendly multiplier of THREADS_PER_BLOCK
my_kernel<<<N/THREADS_PER_BLOCK,THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(args)

// N is not a friendly multiplier of THREADS_PER_BLOCK
my_kernel<<<(N + THREADS_PER_BLOCK-1) / THREADS_PER_BLOCK, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(args);
```

#### Accessing threadId

Within the kernel, the following build-in variables can be referenced:

```.cpp
int blockIdx  // This variable contains the block index within the grid.
int threadIdx // This variable contains the thread index within the block.
```

<!-- gridDim describes number of blocks in the grid.
blockDim describes number of threads in the block.
// dim3 dimBlock(blocksize, blocksize);
// dim3 dimGrid(N/dimBlock.x, N/dimBlock.y); -->

### Maximum number of threads in a block

The maximum number of threads in the block is limited to 1024. This is the product of whatever your threadblock dimensions are (x*y*z). For example (32,32,1) creates a block of 1024 threads. (33,32,1) is not legal, since 33*32*1 > 1024.

### Command line utilities

```.sh
$ nvidia-smi # NVIDIA System Management Interface program

$ cuda-memcheck # checks for memory erros within the program

$ nvprof  # command-line CUDA profiler (logger)

$ cuda-gdb # Linux and mac (debugger)
```

### Device Query

```.sh
`sudo apt-get install cuda-samples-10-2`
`cp -r /usr/local/cuda-10.2/samples/ NVIDIA_CUDA-10.2_Samples`

`~/NVIDIA_CUDA-10.2_Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery$ ./deviceQuery` 
./deviceQuery Starting...
```

Sample output

```.sh
