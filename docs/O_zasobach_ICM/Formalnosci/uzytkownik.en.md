The ICM supercomputing facilities are available to every employee and
PhD student (upon supervisor's acceptance) of a Polish university or
scientific institute. Access to HPC resources is managed through
computational grants.

A User is allowed to:

* submit a grant application and become its principal investigator
  (PI), provided that he/she is a researcher (i.e. holds a PhD degree),
* become an co-investigator in a grant (upon being accepted by the PI),
* submit a grant application as a didactic resource for teaching.
